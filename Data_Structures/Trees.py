"""
Trees:
    1. storing hierarchical data with a directed flow > nodes hold data
    2. Nodes also store references to zero or more other tree nodes. Data moves down from node to node
    3. Tree grows downward & root node is at the very top followed by child Nodes and leafs.
    4. Nodes share the same parent node, which makes them siblings.
    5. When a node has no children, we refer to it as a leaf node.
    6. Each node will only ever have at most one parent i.e. No child node will have more than one parent.
Tree Varieties:
    1. Wide: parent nodes referencing many child nodes.
    2. Deep : with many parent-child relationships.
Each time we move from a parent to a child, weâ€™re moving down a level.
Depending on the orientation we refer to this as the
    a. depth (counting levels down from the root node)
    b. height (counting levels up from a leaf node)

1. Binary Tree:
    1. Tree where each parent can have no more than two children, known as the left child and right child.
    2. If applied the below constraints it becomes Binary Search Tree:
        a. Left child values must be lesser than their parent.
        b. Right child values must be greater than their parent.
